# Biome

Google solution challange application.

## Description

We have developed the "Biome" mobile application to address critical issues such as "climate action" and "life on land". The app offers an opportunity for everyone to make a tangible contribution by purchasing virtual trees, which directly impacts the environment in real life. Additionally, "Biome" serves as an educational platform with an emphasis on plant care, providing users with simple tasks to enhance their gardening skills. We have also established a supportive community within the app to guide and assist users throughout their journey towards achieving a green and sustainable lifestyle.

# Installation

 - Clone the repository to your local machine 
 - Install the dependencies using flutter pub get 
 - Run the app using flutter run

## Usage

Currently, the application's UI has been implemented, and as of now, all screens are static with no backend logic. To manage the state, we have utilized GetX. We plan to incorporate Firebase soon to enhance the application's functionality.
